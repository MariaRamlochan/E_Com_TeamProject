# E_Com_TeamProject
The project turns around our kijiji knockoff application. It is a secons hand website where people can post their unwantd items and interested buyers will be able to contact 
the seller to make the transaction.

The most interesting user stories that we had to make was the Modal. The modal stands out compared to just having to change a page to display the information. it is a prettier
way to display informations.

the hardest user story that we had to do was the messaging system.
